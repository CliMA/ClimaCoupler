    CouplerState()

Type for holding coupler "state". This is the namespace through which coupled components
communicate. Its role is to provide a level of indirection so that components remain modular
and so that any data communication, interpolation, reindexing/unit conversions and filtering 
etc... can be embeded in the intermdediate coupling layer.

A field is exported by one component and imported by one or more other components.
